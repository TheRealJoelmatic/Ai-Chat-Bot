# ChatGPT API Chat Bot in C#

This project demonstrates how to create a chat bot in C# using the ChatGPT API provided by OpenAI. The bot is capable of role-playing as anything or anyone and can answer a wide range of questions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following:

- [OpenAI ChatGPT API key](https://platform.openai.com/signup) - Obtain your API key by signing up for the OpenAI platform.
- [.NET 5.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) - Ensure you have the .NET 5.0 SDK installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

- .1. Download the Chat Bot.zip file from [Releases](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/Ai-Chat-Bot/releases/tag/Main)

- .2. Open the aiTest.exe file

- .3. When asked `(Open AI) Key:` type it in.

- .4. And it should all work

## Customization

You can customize the behavior and responses of the bot by modifying the code in the `Program.cs` file. Here are a few suggestions:
- Implement additional logic to handle specific user inputs or perform additional actions.
- Adjust the conversation context or add context-specific responses.

## Limitations

Keep in mind the following limitations of the ChatGPT API:

- The API has rate limits, which may affect the number of requests you can make within a specific timeframe.
- Long conversations may receive incomplete replies, as the API enforces a maximum token limit (4096 tokens for gpt-3.5-turbo).
- The model may sometimes produce incorrect or nonsensical answers, so it's important to review and validate the responses.
